        <h2>Company Origins</h2><br>
<b>Nova's</b> roots go back at least as far as 1975, when the first commercially available personal computer appeared on the cover of Popular Electronics magazine. The Altair 8800 was a rudimentary system, but it found a market for home-based computers and created a new demand for software to use with these systems.

Cory Hanks and his friend Paul Johnson immediately saw the potential. Hanks contacted the manufacturer Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) and offered to write a program for the new computer. Hanks and  created an interpreter for BASIC -- then a mainframe programming language -- to use with the Altair. </div>
